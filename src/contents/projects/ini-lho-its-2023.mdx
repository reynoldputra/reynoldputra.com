## Project Goals
Ini Lho ITS! 2023 is an **annual event** and one of the biggest events at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. The event helps high school students find majors that match their dreams, talents, and interests. The website serves as a comprehensive platform that goes beyond just showcasing our university—it handles event management, registrations, and announcements for thousands of users.

I was invited as an **expert backend engineer** for this project when I was in my second year, joining a team of 7 people. This was a significant opportunity to work on a large-scale system that would serve **1000+ users** across Indonesia.

## Technology
We built a robust backend service using modern technologies to handle the scale and complexity of the event.

### Backend Service
- **Nest.js** with TypeScript as the main framework
- **Prisma** as the ORM for database management and migrations
- RESTful API architecture for all event operations
- Database integration for managing users, registrations, and announcements

## Features
The platform served multiple purposes beyond just showcasing the university:

- **Tryout registration system.** Students could register for tryout exams directly through the website, streamlining the registration process for hundreds of participants.
- **Organization management.** We managed organizations for each city across Indonesia, allowing local coordinators to handle their regional events and participants.
- **Event registration.** Comprehensive event registration system that handled multiple events, sessions, and activities throughout the event period.
- **Discount management.** System for managing and applying discounts for various event packages and registrations.
- **Announcement system.** Real-time announcements including ranking results, event updates, and important information for all participants.
- **University showcase.** Information about majors, programs, and campus life to help high school students make informed decisions.

## Challenge

### Leading hiring and building the team
One of my responsibilities was conducting **hiring sessions** for the backend team. Since we were looking for first-year students, I needed to create an accessible yet meaningful evaluation process:

- **Technical tests.** I created simple technical tests in a LeetCode-style format that assessed problem-solving skills and basic programming knowledge appropriate for first-year students.
- **Behavioral interviews.** Conducted behavioral interviews to assess communication skills, teamwork, and motivation—essential qualities for working in a collaborative team environment.

This experience taught me how to evaluate candidates at different skill levels and design assessments that are fair yet challenging.

### Teaching and mentoring staff
I also conducted **teaching sessions** for the staff members, sharing knowledge about:
- Backend development best practices
- Nest.js framework patterns and architecture
- API design principles
- Database design and optimization
- Testing strategies

This was my first experience in a teaching/mentoring role, which helped me develop communication skills and learn how to break down complex concepts for others.

### First time learning Nest.js and Prisma
This project was my **first exposure to Nest.js and Prisma**. When I started with Nest.js, I discovered that it comes with **TypeORM by default** as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) solution.

However, during development, I found **Prisma** and was immediately impressed by its advantages:
- **Better typing.** Prisma provides excellent TypeScript support with auto-generated types that ensure type safety throughout the application. The generated types are always in sync with the database schema, reducing type-related bugs.
- **Cool migration system.** Prisma's migration system is intuitive and powerful. It tracks schema changes, generates migration files automatically, and provides a clear history of database evolution. The migration workflow made it easy to manage database changes across different environments.

I made the decision to switch from TypeORM to Prisma for this project, which turned out to be a great choice. Prisma's developer experience, especially the type safety and migration system, significantly improved our development workflow and reduced potential errors.

This experience taught me the importance of evaluating different tools and not just accepting default choices, even when they come from a well-established framework like Nest.js.

### Building comprehensive APIs
I had the responsibility to build APIs for various critical features:

- **Staff and user registration.** Secure registration system with role-based access control for staff members and public registration for users/participants.
- **Certification generation.** Automated system to generate and distribute certificates for participants, handling different event types and completion criteria.
- **Ranking announcement.** System to calculate, store, and announce rankings for tryout results and various competitions, ensuring accuracy and real-time updates.
- **Link shortening service.** Custom URL shortening service for sharing event links, tracking clicks, and managing redirects efficiently.

Each API required careful consideration of:
- **Scalability** to handle 1000+ users
- **Data integrity** for critical operations like rankings and certifications
- **Security** for user data and staff access
- **Performance** to ensure fast response times during peak usage

### Managing scale and complexity
Working on a system that serves 1000+ users across multiple cities in Indonesia presented unique challenges:
- Managing data for multiple regional organizations
- Ensuring real-time updates for announcements and tryout score
- Coordinating with frontend team and event organizers

## Outcome
This project was an **amazing experience** that significantly impacted my growth:

- **Expanded network.** I got to know many people from different majors across the university, building connections that extended beyond just the technical team.
- **Increased exposure.** Working on one of the biggest annual events gave me visibility and recognition within the university community.
- **Leadership experience.** Leading hiring, teaching sessions, and building critical APIs gave me confidence in technical leadership roles.
- **Real-world impact.** Seeing the system handle 1000+ users and support a major event was incredibly rewarding and validated my technical skills.
- **Team collaboration.** Working in a team of 7 people taught me valuable lessons about coordination, communication, and delivering under deadlines.

This project marked an important milestone in my journey, combining technical challenges with leadership opportunities and real-world impact.

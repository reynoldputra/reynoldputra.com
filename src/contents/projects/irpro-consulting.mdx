description : This is my project in early 2023. I got invited as developer in a team of 4 people. We created company profile website using Next.js, and using PayloadCMS to manage content inside the website, but i mostly do slicing design of the main website

## Project Goals
IRPRO Consulting needed a modern company profile website to showcase their services and expertise. I joined as a **fullstack engineer** in a team of 4 people to build this website using Next.js with PayloadCMS for content management.

My primary responsibilities included:
- Building the main website pages with modern, responsive design
- Implementing smooth animations and interactive elements
- Setting up internationalization (i18n) for multi-language support
- Integrating PayloadCMS with Next.js for content management
- Implementing ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for optimal performance

## Technology
This project was built with a focus on modern web technologies and performance optimization.

### Frontend
- **Next.js** with JavaScript as the main framework
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** for advanced animations
- **i18n** package for internationalization in static generation

### Content Management
- **PayloadCMS** for managing website content
- Multi-language support with automatic data fetching during build

## Features
- **Company profile pages.** I created two main pages for the organization profile, focusing on clean design and smooth user experience.
- **GSAP card animations.** Implemented engaging card animations using GSAP to create dynamic, interactive elements that enhance the visual appeal of the website.
- **Multi-language support.** Integrated i18n to handle multiple languages in a static generation context, ensuring the website works seamlessly across different language versions.
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration).** Set up ISR to automatically rebuild pages when content changes in PayloadCMS, ensuring the website always displays the latest content without manual rebuilds.

## Challenge

### First time learning GSAP: Understanding CSS animation limitations
This was my **first experience with GSAP**, and it came from recognizing the limitations of CSS animations. I discovered that CSS has significant constraints, especially when dealing with:
- **Dynamic width and height calculations** that need to be computed at runtime
- **Complex position calculations** that depend on other elements or user interactions
- **Sequential animations** that require precise timing control

CSS animations work great for simple, predefined transitions, but when you need animations that respond to dynamic content or user interactions, JavaScript becomes necessary. GSAP provided the powerful animation library I needed to create smooth, performant animations that CSS alone couldn't achieve.

### Creating card animations with GSAP
I implemented card animations using GSAP, which allowed me to:
- Create smooth transitions that respond to dynamic content sizes
- Build complex animation sequences with precise timing
- Achieve better performance compared to CSS animations for complex scenarios
- Have fine-grained control over animation properties and easing functions

This experience taught me when to use CSS animations (simple, static animations) versus JavaScript animations (complex, dynamic animations).

### First time learning i18n: Internationalization for static generation
This project introduced me to **internationalization (i18n)** for the first time. I needed to find an i18n solution that worked with Next.js static site generation, which has different requirements compared to client-side or server-side rendering.

I researched and found an i18n package specifically designed for static generation pages, which:
- Pre-renders all language versions during the build process
- Ensures all translations are available at build time
- Works seamlessly with Next.js static export functionality
- Maintains performance by including translations in the static bundle

This was a valuable learning experience in understanding how internationalization works in different rendering contexts.

### First time learning ISR: Incremental Static Regeneration with PayloadCMS
This project was my **first exposure to ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**. PayloadCMS supports multiple languages, and during the build process, it fetches all data for all language versions.

The challenge was ensuring that when content changes in PayloadCMS, the website reflects those changes without requiring a full rebuild. I implemented a solution using:
- **Webhook integration** that triggers when content is updated in PayloadCMS
- **API endpoint** that handles revalidation requests
- **ISR revalidation** that rebuilds only the affected pages, not the entire site

When data changes in PayloadCMS, the webhook calls our API endpoint, which then triggers Next.js to revalidate and rebuild the particular page. This approach ensures:
- Content updates are reflected quickly without manual intervention
- Only changed pages are rebuilt, maintaining fast build times
- The website always displays the latest content from PayloadCMS
- Optimal performance with static pages that update on-demand

This experience taught me the power of ISR for content-heavy websites that need to balance static performance with dynamic content updates.

## Outcome
- Successfully delivered a modern company profile website with smooth animations and multi-language support
- Gained hands-on experience with GSAP, understanding when and how to use JavaScript animations effectively
- Learned i18n implementation for static generation, expanding my knowledge of internationalization strategies
- Implemented ISR with PayloadCMS, creating a system that automatically updates content when changes are made
- Built confidence in working with headless CMS systems and understanding their integration with Next.js

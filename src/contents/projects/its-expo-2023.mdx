## Project Goals
ITS EXPO is an **annual art exhibition** held by Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya that exhibits artworks and technology innovations of ITS students to be shown to the public, with a remarkable closing featuring various artists at the end of the show.

After successfully working on [Ini Lho ITS 2023](/projects/ini-lho-its-2023), I was **invited by the same team** to work on ITS Expo 2023. This was a great opportunity to continue working with a team I already knew and trusted, applying lessons learned from the previous project.

I joined as an **expert backend engineer** within a team of 8 people, taking on similar responsibilities but with a different technology stack and new challenges.

## Technology
This project used a different technology stack compared to Ini Lho ITS, giving me experience with multiple backend frameworks.

### Backend Service
- **Laravel** as the main framework
- RESTful API architecture for event management and registration
- Database integration for managing events, registrations, and exhibitions

## Features
The application served as a platform for the annual art exhibition:

- **Event showcase.** Displayed information about various events, exhibitions, and activities held during ITS Expo 2023.
- **Event registration.** Registration system for participants to sign up for different events and activities throughout the exhibition.
- **Artwork and innovation display.** Platform to showcase student artworks and technology innovations to the public.

## Challenge

### Familiar process, new context
Similar to Ini Lho ITS, I went through the **same processes** of hiring and teaching junior developers. However, this time I had more experience and could apply lessons learned from the previous project:

- **Hiring sessions.** Conducted technical assessments and behavioral interviews for junior backend developers.
- **Teaching and mentoring.** Provided guidance on Laravel best practices, API design, and backend development principles.

This consistency in process helped me refine my approach to team building and knowledge transfer.

### Learning Laravel from experienced teammates
While **Laravel was actually my first framework** when I started learning web development, this project taught me new things from my friends and teammates:

- **Advanced Laravel patterns** and architectural approaches I hadn't explored before
- **Best practices** specific to Laravel that experienced developers shared
- **Framework-specific optimizations** and techniques for better performance
- **Community conventions** and Laravel ecosystem tools

This experience reinforced that there's always more to learn, even with frameworks you're familiar with. Working with experienced developers exposed me to patterns and practices I hadn't discovered on my own.

### Refactoring validation and error handling
There was a time when we **screwed up the field validation process** and didn't standardize the format of error messages. This created significant problems:

- **Inconsistent error responses** made it difficult for the frontend team to handle errors uniformly
- **Different validation approaches** across different endpoints created confusion
- **Poor error message formatting** led to poor user experience and debugging difficulties

I took the initiative to **refactor this part** to make it more best practice and standardized:

- **Unified validation approach** using Laravel's validation features consistently
- **Standardized error message format** that the frontend team could easily parse and display
- **Consistent error response structure** across all API endpoints
- **Better error handling** that provided clear, actionable feedback

This refactoring significantly improved the developer experience for both backend and frontend teams, making error handling predictable and maintainable.

### Learning better SDLC practices
This project was where I learned about **better Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) practices**:

- **Code review process.** I didn't write as much code since we had junior developers handling feature development. Instead, I focused on reviewing their Pull Requests (PRs).
- **Focus on code quality.** I concentrated on identifying potential bugs, reviewing code style, and ensuring best practices were followed.
- **Mentorship through reviews.** Code reviews became a teaching opportunity, where I could guide juniors on better approaches and catch issues before they reached production.
- **Separation of concerns.** Juniors created PRs for new features, while I focused on bug fixes, architecture decisions, and maintaining code quality standards.

This approach taught me:
- **The importance of code reviews** in maintaining quality and knowledge transfer
- **How to balance** between writing code and reviewing others' work
- **Effective mentorship** through constructive feedback in PR reviews
- **Better project management** by focusing on high-impact activities like architecture and quality assurance

This experience shifted my perspective from being primarily a code writer to being a code reviewer and mentor, which is a crucial skill for senior developers.

## Outcome
- Successfully delivered a backend service for the annual art exhibition, supporting event management and registration
- Gained deeper understanding of Laravel by learning from experienced teammates
- Improved code quality and maintainability through refactoring validation and error handling
- Learned valuable SDLC practices, particularly around code review and mentorship
- Developed skills in code review, identifying potential bugs, and providing constructive feedback
- Built stronger relationships with the team through continued collaboration from the previous project

This project reinforced the importance of code quality, standardization, and effective team processes, while giving me hands-on experience in a more senior role focused on review and mentorship rather than just writing code.

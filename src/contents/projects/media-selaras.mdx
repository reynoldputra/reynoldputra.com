## Project Goals
Media Selaras is a community that provides education about education, the economy, health, and other topics. The organization needed a modern website to showcase their content, manage news articles, and provide information about the organization.

I **randomly joined this media organization** and was accepted as **one of two fullstack engineers** working on the project. This was an exciting opportunity to work on a real-world application with a friend, building something from scratch that would serve an actual community.

We developed this website using **Next.js with TypeScript** as the frontend and **Laravel** as the backend, creating a full-stack application with a CMS dashboard for content management.

## Technology
This project was my **first time building a production application** with Next.js and Laravel, which provided valuable hands-on experience with both frameworks.

### Frontend
- **Next.js** with TypeScript as the main framework
- Design system implementation from Figma designs
- Server-side middleware for authentication

### Backend
- **Laravel** as the backend API
- RESTful API architecture
- CMS dashboard for content management
- Shared hosting deployment

## Features
- **Organization page.** Full-stack page showcasing information about Media Selaras, their mission, team, and activities.
- **News page.** Dynamic news listing and detail pages with content management capabilities.
- **CMS dashboard.** Admin dashboard built with Laravel for managing organization content, news articles, and website content.
- **Authentication system.** Secure authentication integrated with Next.js middleware for protected routes and user management.

## Challenge

### First time learning about design systems
This project introduced me to **design systems** for the first time. I learned how to:

- **Convert Figma designs to frontend code** systematically
- **Understand design tokens** like colors, typography, spacing, and components
- **Maintain consistency** across different pages and components
- **Work with design specifications** and translate them into functional UI components

This experience taught me the importance of having a structured approach to design implementation, ensuring visual consistency and making the development process more efficient. Understanding design systems became a valuable skill that I've applied in all subsequent projects.

### First production app with Next.js and Laravel
This was my **first time building a production application** with Next.js and Laravel. While I had experience with both technologies separately, combining them in a production environment presented new challenges:

- **API integration** between Next.js frontend and Laravel backend
- **Type safety** across the full stack with TypeScript
- **Error handling** and data flow between frontend and backend
- **Production considerations** like performance, security, and deployment

This project gave me confidence in building full-stack applications and understanding how different parts of a system work together.

### Discovering Next.js middleware: Understanding server-side capabilities
Working on authentication, I used **Next.js middleware** for the first time. This was a significant learning moment because I realized that **Next.js isn't just different from React—it's not just a frontend framework**.

Key realizations:
- **Middleware runs server-side** before the request reaches the page, allowing for server-side logic execution
- **Authentication checks** can happen at the middleware level, protecting routes before rendering
- **Server-side capabilities** enable features that pure React (client-side) cannot provide
- **Request/response manipulation** is possible at the middleware level

This understanding opened my eyes to the power of Next.js beyond just being "React with routing." The middleware feature showed me that Next.js is a full-stack framework that can handle server-side logic, not just client-side rendering.

Implementing authentication in Next.js middleware taught me:
- How to protect routes server-side before page rendering
- The difference between client-side and server-side authentication checks
- How middleware can intercept and modify requests
- The security benefits of server-side route protection

### Building full-stack pages with CMS
I created **full-stack pages** for the organization and news sections, integrating them with a CMS dashboard:

- **Organization page.** Displayed dynamic content about Media Selaras that could be managed through the CMS
- **News page.** Implemented news listing and detail pages with content fetched from the Laravel backend
- **CMS integration.** Connected the frontend to the Laravel CMS dashboard, ensuring content updates reflected immediately on the website

This experience taught me how to build content-driven applications where non-technical users can manage website content without touching code.

### Deploying Laravel on shared hosting
For cost optimization, we deployed Laravel on **shared hosting** (for less cost, lol). This presented unique challenges:

- **Limited server access** compared to VPS or dedicated servers
- **Configuration constraints** of shared hosting environments
- **File permissions** and directory structure requirements
- **Performance optimization** within shared hosting limitations
- **Database configuration** on shared hosting

This experience taught me:
- How to work within hosting constraints
- Cost-effective deployment strategies
- Adapting applications to different hosting environments
- Troubleshooting deployment issues in limited-access environments

While shared hosting has limitations, this experience taught me to be resourceful and find solutions that work within budget constraints—a valuable skill for real-world projects.

## Outcome
- Successfully delivered a full-stack application for Media Selaras with organization and news pages
- Gained first-hand experience with design systems and converting Figma designs to code
- Built confidence in creating production applications with Next.js and Laravel
- Learned the power of Next.js middleware and server-side capabilities beyond React
- Implemented a working CMS dashboard that allows non-technical users to manage content
- Gained experience with cost-effective deployment strategies using shared hosting
- Developed skills in full-stack development, understanding how frontend and backend work together
- Built a real-world application that serves an actual community

This project was a significant milestone in my development journey, combining multiple first-time experiences into a cohesive production application that taught me the practical aspects of full-stack development.

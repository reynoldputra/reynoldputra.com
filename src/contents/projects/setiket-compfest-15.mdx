## Context

In September 2023, I joined **Compfest Academy** - the biggest student-held IT event in Indonesia organized by University of Indonesia. From **1000 participants**, I was selected as one of **20 students** to participate in an intensive one-month bootcamp.

The bootcamp provided real industry experience in software engineering, with mentorship from **senior engineers from PinHome and Tiket.com**. This was an incredible opportunity to learn from professionals working at major tech companies in Indonesia.

At the end of the bootcamp, we had to create a project in a **team of 4**. We built **Setiket** - an application for ticket registration and event appointment management.

## Compfest Academy Experience

### Intensive Bootcamp

The one-month bootcamp was intensive and focused on real-world software engineering:

- Learning from **senior engineers** at PinHome and Tiket.com
- Understanding industry best practices and standards
- Working on practical projects and challenges
- Getting feedback from experienced professionals

This experience was valuable because it exposed me to how software engineering works in real companies, not just academic projects.

### Networking and Collaboration

One of the most valuable aspects was the **networking opportunity**:

- Meeting students from different universities across Indonesia
- Learning from their diverse experiences and backgrounds
- Building connections that extended beyond the bootcamp
- Collaborating with talented peers on challenging projects

## Project: Setiket

### Requirements

We needed to create an application for **ticket registration and event appointment** management. The app had to handle:

- Event creation and management
- Ticket registration and booking
- User dashboard for managing events
- Participant dashboard for booking events

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Nest.js with TypeScript (I initiated using Nest.js because of my previous experience with it)

I suggested Nest.js for the backend because I had experience with it from previous projects (like Ini Lho ITS 2023), and I knew it would provide a solid foundation with good structure, TypeScript support, and scalability.

## Features

Setiket provided two main dashboards:

### Event Organizer Dashboard

- **Create and manage events**: Organizers could create events, set details, dates, and capacity
- **Manage participants**: View registered participants, manage ticket sales, and track attendance
- **Event analytics**: Monitor event performance and registration statistics

### User Dashboard

- **Browse events**: Users could search and browse available events
- **Book tickets**: Register for events and manage their bookings
- **Booking history**: View past event registrations and appointments

## My Contributions

### Backend Architecture

I initiated and led the backend development using **Nest.js**:

- **API design**: Structured RESTful endpoints for event and booking management
- **Authentication**: User authentication and authorization system
- **Database design**: Schema design for events, users, and bookings
- **Integration**: Connecting frontend and backend seamlessly

My experience with Nest.js from previous projects helped the team move faster and maintain code quality.

### Team Collaboration

Working in a team of 4 taught me:

- **Technical leadership**: Taking initiative on technology decisions
- **Code organization**: Structuring the project for team collaboration
- **Communication**: Coordinating between frontend and backend development
- **Time management**: Delivering a complete project within the bootcamp timeline

## Achievement

On **September 23, 2023**, we attended the graduation night at **Fasilkom UI Jakarta**. Our team was awarded **"Best Software Engineer Team"** - a recognition of our technical implementation, code quality, and project execution.

This achievement validated our hard work during the bootcamp and the quality of the Setiket application we built.

## Reflection

This experience was incredibly valuable for several reasons:

- **Industry exposure**: Learning from senior engineers at major tech companies gave me insights into real-world software engineering practices
- **Networking**: Meeting talented students from different universities expanded my network and exposed me to diverse perspectives
- **Technical growth**: Building a complete application under mentorship helped me apply best practices and improve my skills
- **Recognition**: Winning "Best Software Engineer Team" was a confidence boost and validation of our technical abilities
- **Teamwork**: Working effectively in a team of 4 under time constraints taught me valuable collaboration skills

The Compfest Academy bootcamp was a significant milestone in my development journey, combining intensive learning, real-world application, and meaningful connections with peers and industry professionals.

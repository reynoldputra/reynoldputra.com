## Project Goals 
Society of Renewable Energy Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (SRE ITS) exists as a student organization dedicated to increasing student interest and knowledge of new and renewable energy. This website serves as the organization's digital profile, showcasing SRE ITS's activities, achievements, and information about renewable energy initiatives.

I was chosen as the IT Director to lead the development of this website, managing a team of 13 people across three divisions: Backend, Frontend, and UI/UX.

## Technology
In this project, I was responsible for leading the development team and establishing the technical architecture.

### Frontend Service
- **Next.js** with TypeScript as the main framework
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** for creating acrobatic and smooth animations on the landing page
- Modern CSS and responsive design principles

### Backend Service
- **Golang** as the backend service for the CMS
- Database hosted on VPS for content management

### Content Management System (CMS)
- Custom-built admin dashboard using Golang
- Database integration for managing all website content

## Features
- **Acrobatic landing page with GSAP animations.** I created the landing page myself because I wanted it to be special with engaging animations. Using GSAP, I implemented smooth, acrobatic animations that create a unique and memorable user experience when visitors first land on the website.

- **Blogging system.** The website includes a comprehensive blogging feature where all content is saved to a database hosted on VPS. This allows the organization to regularly publish articles about renewable energy, events, and updates.

- **Admin dashboard for content management.** We built a custom admin dashboard using Golang that enables administrators to manage all content on the website, including blog posts, organization information, and other dynamic content.

## Challenge
**Managing a team of 13 people across multiple divisions.** As IT Director, I needed to coordinate Backend, Frontend, and UI/UX teams effectively. I created a communication system where each division has a manager who directly reports to me and is responsible for their own staff. This hierarchical structure ensured clear communication channels and accountability while allowing me to maintain oversight of the entire development process.

**Coordinating development through weekly meetings and Clickup.** To keep the project on track, I established a system of weekly meetings with division managers and utilized Clickup to manage the whole development process. This approach helped us track progress, identify blockers early, and ensure all team members were aligned with project goals and deadlines.

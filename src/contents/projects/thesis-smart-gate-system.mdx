## Overview

Traffic congestion at campus gates is often caused by **manual vehicle verification** and **card-based access systems**. Drivers are required to stop, show documents, or tap access cards, which slows down traffic and reduces user experience.

In this final thesis project, I designed and built a **Smart Gate System** that automates vehicle access by combining:

- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** for driver authentication and position detection
- **License Plate Recognition (LPR)** for vehicle identity verification

The system verifies that **the correct driver and the correct vehicle are present at the gate**, then opens the gate automatically without manual interaction.

## Problem Statement

Existing gate systems typically rely on:

- Manual checking of vehicle documents
- RFID or electronic access cards
- Visual inspection by security staff

These approaches suffer from several limitations:

- Long queues during peak hours
- High dependency on human operators
- Risk of misuse (card sharing, identity mismatch)
- No real-time validation of driver–vehicle pairing

An automated, secure, and context-aware gate system is required to improve **efficiency, security, and scalability**.

## Proposed Solution

I proposed a **Smart Gate System architecture** that integrates **BLE-based authentication** and **camera-based license plate recognition**.

### Core Ideas

- Drivers carry a **BLE beacon (ESP32)** or smartphone
- Cameras capture the vehicle's license plate near the gate
- The system verifies:
  - The driver's BLE identity
  - The vehicle's license plate
  - The physical proximity of the driver to the gate
- The gate opens automatically only if all validations succeed

This ensures that **identity, vehicle, and location** form a valid combination.

## System Architecture

### Hardware Components

- ESP32 as BLE Beacon (driver identifier)
- Multiple ESP32-based BLE Receivers
- Camera for license plate capture
- Gate controller (motor/relay)

### Software Components

- BLE scanning and authentication service
- RSSI-based distance estimation
- BLE localization with trilateration
- License Plate Recognition (LPR) service
- Backend validation and gate control service

## System Workflow

1. **BLE Authentication**  
   The driver's beacon broadcasts a unique encrypted identifier.

2. **Position Verification**  
   RSSI values from multiple receivers are used to estimate the driver's position and proximity to the gate.

3. **License Plate Recognition**  
   A camera captures the vehicle image and detects the license plate using LPR.

4. **Data Validation**  
   The backend verifies:
   - Beacon identity
   - License plate number
   - Registered driver–vehicle pairing

5. **Gate Control**  
   If all checks pass, the gate opens automatically via a REST API.

## BLE Localization Approach

BLE localization is used **not as a standalone feature**, but to ensure that the driver is **physically near the gate**.

- RSSI values are collected from multiple receivers
- Distance is estimated using a path-loss model
- **Kalman Filter** and **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** are applied to reduce noise
- **Trilateration** is used to estimate driver position

This prevents unauthorized access attempts from distant or spoofed devices.

## License Plate Recognition

The LPR component is responsible for:

- Detecting license plates from camera input
- Extracting plate numbers using OCR
- Providing real-time plate data to the backend

LPR adds an additional security layer by ensuring the **vehicle identity matches the registered driver**.

## Key Technical Challenges

### RSSI Noise and Environmental Interference

BLE signals fluctuate due to obstacles and reflections.

**Solution:**  
Signal filtering using Kalman Filter and SMA on a per-receiver basis.

### Device Impersonation Risk

BLE identifiers can be spoofed.

**Solution:**  

- Encrypted challenge–response mechanism
- Binding BLE identity to backend records

### Synchronization Between BLE and LPR

BLE and camera systems operate at different speeds.

**Solution:**  

- Time-window–based data correlation
- Backend validation logic before gate activation

## Results & Evaluation

- BLE authentication completed within **60–90 ms**
- License plates were accurately detected within **0–2 meters**
- Gate opening latency ranged from **1.00 to 3.99 seconds**
- Position accuracy improved with additional receivers

The system successfully demonstrated **hands-free, automatic gate access** in a campus environment.

## Tech Stack

- **Hardware:** ESP32, Camera module
- **Protocols:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), REST API
- **Languages:** Python, C/C++
- **Computer Vision:** YOLO, OCR
- **Algorithms:**
  - RSSI Path-Loss Model
  - Kalman Filter
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  - Trilateration

## Key Learnings

- Combining multiple validation methods significantly improves security
- BLE localization is effective when scoped to proximity validation
- End-to-end system integration is more complex than individual components
- Real-world testing is critical for signal-based systems

## Future Improvements

- Support for four-wheeled vehicles
- Deeper security testing against spoofing and replay attacks
- Integration with UWB for higher positioning accuracy
- Production-grade monitoring and observability

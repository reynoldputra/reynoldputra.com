## Context

Umbahin was a **college assignment** project - a mobile application for laundry service management. The app connects users with nearby laundry providers, allows them to place orders, and track order status.

I worked on this project with **4 team members**, focusing on both frontend and backend development.

### Project link :
- [Frontend](https://github.com/reynoldputra/umbahin)
- [Backend](https://github.com/reynoldputra/laundry-app-backend)

## Technology

- **Frontend**: React Native with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js)
- **External APIs**: Google Maps API for location services

## Features

- **User authentication**: Registration and login system
- **Laundry provider listing**: Browse nearby laundry services with location information
- **Order management**: Create orders, view order history, and check order status
- **Google Maps integration**: Display provider locations and calculate distances

## My Contributions

### Frontend: Laundry Provider List Page

I worked on the **laundry provider list page** in the React Native app:

- Displaying a list of available laundry providers
- Integrating with Google Maps to show provider locations
- Implementing search and filter functionality
- Creating a clean, user-friendly interface for browsing providers

### Backend: Complete API Development

I built the **entire backend** from scratch using Express.js ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/reynoldputra/laundry-app-backend)):

- **Authentication system**
  - User registration
  - Basic authentication (login/logout)
  - Session management
- **Laundry provider endpoints**
  - List all laundry providers
  - Provider details
- **Order management**
  - Create new orders
  - List user orders
  - Check order status
- **API structure**
  - RESTful endpoint design
  - Request/response handling
  - Error handling

## Key Learnings

### React Native vs Web React

Even though we used React, **React Native is quite different from web development**:

- **Native APIs**: React Native provides access to device-specific features (camera, location, push notifications) that don't exist in web React
- **Platform-specific code**: Some features require platform-specific implementations (iOS vs Android)
- **Navigation**: Mobile navigation patterns are different from web routing
- **Styling**: Uses a subset of CSS with some platform-specific considerations

This was my first time building a mobile app, and it taught me that mobile development has its own set of challenges and patterns, even when using familiar technologies.

### Backend Best Practices from Scratch

Since the backend didn't have too many endpoints, I focused on learning and implementing **best practices from scratch** with Express:

- **Logging setup**: Implementing proper logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Middleware**: Understanding and using Express middleware for authentication, error handling, and request processing
- **Validation**: Input validation to ensure data integrity and security
- **Design patterns**: Applying common patterns like MVC, service layers, and repository patterns
- **Code organization**: Structuring the codebase for maintainability and scalability

This experience was valuable because I learned these concepts by implementing them myself rather than using a framework that handles everything automatically. It gave me a deeper understanding of how these practices work under the hood.

### Google Maps Integration

Integrating Google Maps API taught me:
- Working with external APIs and handling API keys securely
- Processing location data and calculating distances
- Displaying maps in mobile applications
- Handling location permissions and user privacy

## Reflection

This project was a good learning experience for both mobile and backend development:

- **Mobile development** introduced me to the differences between web and native app development
- **Building a backend from scratch** with Express helped me understand fundamental concepts like middleware, validation, and proper API design
- Working in a **team of 4** taught me about collaboration, code organization, and dividing responsibilities

The straightforward nature of the project (college assignment) allowed me to focus on learning the fundamentals without overcomplicating things.
